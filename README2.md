The code beginning by all the files I need to compute my work by the function read.table(). One of our goals is to merge the training and the testing datasets to obtain one global dataset to apply the mean & standard deviation.
Before merge the data with a combinaison of functions rbind + cbind, I rename all my columns to have understanding datasets.

please find below the instructions of the work :

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
